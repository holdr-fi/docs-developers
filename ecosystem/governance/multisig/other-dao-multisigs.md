In addition to the Balancer Governance Multisig, the DAO itself has a number of multisigs, both on mainnet and other chains, to perform narrow duties that benefit from more agility and don't demand high levels of trust. The DAO maintains a list of these multisig addresses [here](https://balancergrants.notion.site/bbbaa56e538445cc950a0031983d0d17?v=04e757aaa06a4a5190872410af296fc8).
