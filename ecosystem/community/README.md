# Community

## Overview

The community is the beating heart of the Balancer Protocol. This is where all discussions about Balancer are made and eventually decided on a democratic basis through Governance [Snapshot voting](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer). The Community is made up of all those individuals who are interested in, interact with, and care about the future and success of the Protocol. Participation in discussions is on a voluntary basis and takes place on the Balancer Discord while proposals for implementation and policy changes are discussed on the [Governance Forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/).
