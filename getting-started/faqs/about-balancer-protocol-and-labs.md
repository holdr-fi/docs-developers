# About Balancer Protocol and Labs

## What is Balancer Protocol?

Balancer Protocol is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol built on Ethereum. It facilitates trades as a decentralized exchange, and supports liquidity providers by allowing anyone to create and supply trading pools.

## Who benefits from Balancer Protocol?

Balancer offers value to all parts of the liquidity ecosystem — a self-balancing portfolio for liquidity providers, a deep liquidity source for traders, and flexible platform for developers.

## What networks does Balancer Protocol run on?

Balancer is deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. It's also deployed to the Kovan, Goerli, and Ropsten testnets.

Additionally, there is a [friendly fork on Fantom](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc).

There are no implementations on Tron, or any other networks. Balancer Labs has awarded grants to teams developing on Near and Algorand; however, these are exploratory grants, and does not imply that there are working versions of Balancer Protocol on these systems.

## Who is behind Balancer Labs?

The team behind the Balancer Protocol (Balancer Labs) has been in the DeFi space for a while, and started Balancer as a research project in early 2018.

They have proven that they can ship and maintain a successful DeFi product that is driven by decentralized governance. The team has shown that they respect and care about the ethos of the industry. This collaborative mindset made them built [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), an open-source tool that allows for gasless voting which became the de-facto standard for decentralized governance voting with 800 projects using it as of writing.

Currently there are \~30 Balancer Labs employees, consisting of developers, integrations, marketing, business development, and more.
